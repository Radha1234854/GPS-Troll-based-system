The GPS Toll-based System Simulation project is designed to simulate the movement of vehicles along a predefined route, calculate toll charges at various points, and visualize these movements on a map. The simulation involves tracking the GPS coordinates of vehicles, checking for toll points, and accumulating toll charges in Indian Rupees (â‚¹). The project leverages Python and several key libraries to achieve these objectives.This project effectively simulates vehicle movements, calculates toll charges, and visualizes these on a map. It serves as a foundation for more advanced simulations and real-world applications, such as real-time toll management and vehicle tracking systems. The project can be extended to include more complex routes, dynamic toll charges, and enhanced visualizations for better user interaction and data analysis.
